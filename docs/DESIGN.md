# **Club Website** Design 

**This will be our approach to the website and will have the information that each page should have.**

## **Overall**

**Go more in-depth here on each component. Explain the purpose of the component, what technologies it uses, how it interacts with the other components, where it is in the project, and the current state of it. This can be several paragraphs long. The hope is that it answers any questions someone working on this component might have.** 

As this project is mostly filled with member new to the Web/ Websites/ Web Applications etcâ€¦ building process, we will only be using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The aim is to get all of our project members familiar with the process of creating a website entirely from scratch and then hosting it so it is live to the world. The more advanced things like choosing a framework and building more functionality on the site ( like a calendar application that displays our meetings/ events) can come in a later project.

## Resources 

### **Homepage** Links

1. It should clearly communicate 
  * Who we are 
  * What we do
  * And what members can expect to do as a a part of our club or as a participant in our club activities.  

  In our case, we also want to briefly explain what Open Source is as it is a niche club that not many people know.
  
2. It should also contain our logo
3. Should have a call-to-action like "Join Now" or "see when our "next meeting is" ideally both
4. At the footer of each page, I would like to have our contact listed even thought there will be a dedicated Contact page for it.
  * Github link (with icon)
  * Facebook Link (with icon)
  * Slack Link (with icon)
5. Should have Visual elements like pictures or hopefully a video that plays on loop (Maaybe of a combination of Matt lecturing and casual coding, and even a goofy clip of someone thumbs-upping a pull request)
